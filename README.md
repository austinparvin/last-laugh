# Last Laugh 

After setting up my local machine with node and npm along with git, the project took me about an hour to check off the main points.
Then spent another hour utilizing CSS-Grid, Styled Components, and making it mobile responsive.

## Notable Design Decisions

I went with the mobile design of card after looking up ways to display table data on mobile and came across the design [here](https://medium.com/allenhwkim/mobile-friendly-table-b0cb066dbc0e)
This article implements the design using HTML table elements, however I used CSS-Grid.  In my past work we had been in favor of using flex-box exclusively, so there was a small amount of run up time spent getting familiar with the syntax of CSS-Grid.
Frankly if I were implementing this data into an application I would favor using [MUI's Table Components](https://mui.com/components/tables/) for the sake of maintainability.
